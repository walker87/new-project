        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Lisburn's original site was a fort located north of modern-day Wallace Park. In 1609 James I granted Sir Fulke Conway, a Welshman of Norman descent, the lands of Killultagh in southwest County Antrim. During the 1620s the streets of Lisburn were laid out just as they are today: Market Square, Bridge Street, Castle Street and Bow Street. Conway brought over many English and Welsh settlers during the <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Conditions.ScreenOnly"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Plantation">Ulster Plantation</a></MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Conditions.PrintOnly">Ulster Plantation;</MadCap:conditionalText> he also had a manor house built on what is now Castle Gardens, and in 1623, a church on the site of the current cathedral. In 1628, Sir Edward Conway, brother to the now deceased Sir Fulke, obtained a charter from King Charles I granting the right to hold a weekly market. This is still held in the town every Tuesday. The Manor House was destroyed in the accidental fire of 1707 and was never rebuilt; the city's Latin motto, Ex igne resurgam ("Out of the fire I shall arise"), is a reference to this incident.

        <p>Lisburn is also known as the birthplace of Ireland's linen industry, which was established in 1698 by Louis Crommelin and other Huguenots. An exhibition about the Irish linen industry is now housed in the Irish Linen Centre, which can be found in the old Market House in Market Square.</p>
        <p>
In 1920, disturbances related to the ongoing Irish War of Independence saw almost all of Lisburn's Catholic businesses burned out and many of the town's Catholic population forced to flee. The town was one of the first to recruit special constables, who went on to become part of Northern Ireland's Ulster Special Constabulary.

The Cold War
</h2>
        <p>Between 1954 and 1992 Lisburn contained the operational headquarters of No 31 Belfast Group <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Conditions.ScreenOnly"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observer_Corps">Royal Observer Corps</a></MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Conditions.PrintOnly">Royal Observer Corps</MadCap:conditionalText> who operated from a protected nuclear bunker on Knox Road within Thiepval Barracks. Converted from a 1940s Anti-aircraft Operations Room (AAOR), the bunker would support over one hundred ROC volunteers and a ten-man United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation warning team responsible for the four-minute warning in the event of a nuclear strike on the UK. The ROC would also have detected radioactive fallout from the nuclear bursts and warned the public of approaching fallout.
</p>
        <p>
The two organisations were disbanded in 1992 at the end of the Cold War. In 2007 a commemorative plaque was mounted on the wall of the nuclear bunker which still stands, in recognition of the service of ROC volunteers in Northern Ireland.</p>
