Lisburn railway station</a>
            </MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Conditions.PrintOnly">Lisburn railway station</MadCap:conditionalText> was opened on 12 August 1839. The railway remains a popular means of transport between Lisburn and Belfast, with the express trains taking 10–15 minutes to reach Belfast's Great Victoria Street. The train also links the city directly with Newry, Portadown, Lurgan, Moira and Bangor. The station also has services to Dublin Connolly in the city of Dublin, with three trains per day stopping at the station. All railway services from the station are provided by Northern Ireland Railways, a subsidiary of Translink. The city is also served by Hilden railway station.</p>
